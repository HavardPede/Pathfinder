This application is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm with a graphical user interface. 
The application uses React for the frontend and Java Spring to compute the path in the backend. Frontend and backend communicates through a REST API.

## Future implementation
### Multiple pathfinding algorithms
I want to implement other pathfinding algorithms and allow the user to switch between to see the difference in both performance (and approach).

### Show computed paths aswell as final path
I also want to visualise all tested squares to show how the algorithms works. That way the tool becomes a visualisation of how the algorithm(s) work.
